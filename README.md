#Angular 2 Walkthrough

###NOTES

Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. A component controls a portion of the screen—a view—through its associated template


`<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">`

`<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">`

The `*` prefix to `ngFor` indicates that the <li> element and its children constitute a master template.
